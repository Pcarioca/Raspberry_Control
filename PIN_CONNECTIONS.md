## ‚ö° Power & Ground Pins

### Power Pins (Do NOT use for GPIO control)
- **Pin 1, 17**: 3.3V (max 50mA total)
- **Pin 2, 4**: 5V (connect servo power here, or use external power supply)

### Ground Pins (GND) - All are equivalent
- **Pin 6, 9, 14, 20, 25, 30, 34, 39**: Ground (0V)

## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Setup Guide

### LED Setup
1. Take a 220Œ© resistor (Red-Red-Brown or Red-Red-Black-Black bands)
2. Connect one end to **GPIO 17 (Physical Pin 11)**
3. Connect other end to LED's **longer leg (anode +)**
4. Connect LED's **shorter leg (cathode -)** to **GND (Pin 6 or any GND)**

### Servo Setup
1. Identify the three wires on your servo:
   - **Signal** (usually Orange or Yellow)
   - **Power** (usually Red)
   - **Ground** (usually Brown or Black)
2. Connect **Signal** wire to **GPIO 18 (Physical Pin 12)**
3. Connect **Power** wire to **5V (Pin 2 or 4)** OR external 5V power supply
4. Connect **Ground** wire to **GND (Pin 6 or any GND)**
5. If using external power, connect external GND to Raspberry Pi GND

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Safety Notes

1. **LED Protection**: Always use a resistor (220Œ© recommended) with the LED to prevent damage
2. **Servo Power**: 
   - Small servos (SG90, 9g) can use the Pi's 5V pin
   - Larger servos should use an external 5V power supply
   - Always share common ground between Pi and external power
3. **Never connect 5V to GPIO pins** - GPIO pins are 3.3V tolerant only!
4. **Double-check connections** before powering on

## üîç Troubleshooting

### LED doesn't light up:
- ‚úÖ Check LED polarity (longer leg = +, shorter leg = -)
- ‚úÖ Verify GPIO 17 connection
- ‚úÖ Test with multimeter or swap LED

### Servo doesn't move:
- ‚úÖ Verify power connection (servo needs 5V)
- ‚úÖ Check signal wire is on GPIO 18
- ‚úÖ Ensure common ground connection
- ‚úÖ Try external power supply if servo is large

### Application errors:
- ‚úÖ Run with sudo: `sudo dotnet run`
- ‚úÖ Check GPIO permissions: `sudo usermod -a -G gpio $USER`
